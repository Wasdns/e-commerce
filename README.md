# The project for the E-Commerce course, 2018 Spring.

## Introduction

This project is based on [saleor](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor), an e-commerce storefront for Python and Django. This project focuses on resolving some problems of saleor. 

## Hands-Up Steps

**1.Install saleor by following the [INSTALL.txt](./INSTALL.txt).**

**2.Start local server:**

```
SECRET_KEY='saleor' python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Then you can visit `localhost:8000`.

**3.Login as a superuser:**

You can use the account "saleor@mail.com" with the password "saleor" to login into the saleor dashboard as a superuser.

**4.Add some products to your e-commerce website:**

Go to the dashboard, and create the following things in order:
- Collections: add the label of your products;
- Categories: add the category of your products;
- Products: add your products to a specific category.

We have provided some product figures under the folder [products/](products/). Feel free to use them.
